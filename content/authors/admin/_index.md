  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I am a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience at EPFL, supervised by [Prof. Alexander Mathis](https://mathislab.org). I am currently interning at
[Sony](https://www.sony.com/ja/SonyInfo/research/) in Tokyo. I have lead the [Schindler EPFL Lab](https://regis.schindler.com/en/epfl-lab.html)
for two years before starting my PhD. I hold a MSc in [Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computational-science-and-engineering/) from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a MSc and a BSc from the
[Polytechnic Univeristy of Milan (POLIMI)](https://www.polimi.it/en) in [Mathematical Engineering](https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-magistrale-programmes/programme-detail/mathematical-engineering-1).
